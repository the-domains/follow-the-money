# Following the Money

Did you know that it is possible to watch the large players of the market buy and sell? 

Yes it is! The large funds and players leave huge tracks across the markets as they buy and sell. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dfdd7f65-b075-4ff0-b06a-8a82ba32950d.png)

Do you think that this information might be valuable to you? 

Of course! All you need to do is to position yourself alongside the large fund movements and profit along with them. 

This site is for you to learn how to watch the fund flows yourself. Once you learn how to watch the flow of money in the market, you can position yourself to profit along with them. 

A quick reminder though. This is not a get-rich-quick method. It takes time to let the trade mature. Usually anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months. In truth, this is more of a get-rich-slow method. I know, I know, we all want to get rich as soon as possible. However, we all know how _risky_ get-rich-quick schemes are. With the internet, it seems they are all over. 

What makes this different? Honesty for one. This isn't about binary options or anything else of that rubbish. This is trading the actual markets. A 10 year old can do what I teach you to look for.  Best of all? The information of the movements of the funds, are free online.  All you need to know is where to look, and how to interpret the information. 

That is where I can help. I'll tell you where to go for the free information of the money flow; the same place I go. I will teach you the unique way to interpret the information, which very few people know how to do. I will teach you my preferred way of getting into the market. Once you know how, it will become automatic. You will scan the markets once a week watching for changes in the money flow. You will only spend 10 minutes a day monitoring any open positions. Seriously. Trading the markets can be this easy, and it should be this easy. Since when does the small retail trader need expensive software, and computers, and sit at the desk all day sweating over every single blip in the market? I sure don't operate that way, and neither should you. 

Watch this space for more information as I get this up and running. 

Cheers
